# Project Overview

## 🧠 The Problem

Current AI agents can think but can't **act economically**:
- They can't hold funds or pay for API access
- Every financial action requires a human to approve and execute
- Sequential tool execution makes multi-tool tasks painfully slow
- Payment data is visible on-chain, exposing transaction intent

## ⚡ The Solution

Agent402 gives AI agents **economic agency**:

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| **Autonomous Payments** | Agent evaluates tool cost, pays in LINK/Tokens on SmartBCH — minimal gas fees |
| **Dual Payment Protocols** | AP2 (primary) + x402/Kobaru (secondary) for maximum compatibility |
| **Transaction Privacy** | BITE V2 encrypts transaction payloads on-chain |
| **Real-Time Reasoning** | Gemini 2.5 Flash with parallel tool calling |
| **Open Marketplace** | Anyone can register paid tools — set your price, get paid instantly |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

Agent402 is designed to evolve into a fully autonomous economic layer for AI:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — agents hiring other agents for sub-tasks
- **Mainnet Deployment** — real-value transactions on SmartBCH mainnet
- **Budget Policies** — spending limits and approval workflows
- **Use Cases** — Decentralized storage payments, API subscriptions, erratic compute purchasing
- **DAO Governance** — community-curated tool marketplace
